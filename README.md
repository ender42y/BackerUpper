# BackerUpper

A simple and easy to use file copying software for cloning discs or backing up folders to external hard drives

Welcome to the initial release of Backer Upper. It has been tested for backing up large drives to external drives or for cloning drives faster than the standard windows copy and paste. Backer Upper also keeps track of which copy of a file is newer and lets the user decide before running which copies of files should be kept. Ideal for keeping your drive backed up externally and not wasting time overwriting or confirming windows error. Any errors that do crop up are logged in a simple text file for you to deal with as you see fit.
